Description:

 

For this assignment, I wanted to create a narrative about the future inspired by events from the past using AI. However, I did not want this narrative to be from only my perspective. I wanted this narrative to be from the perspective of my favorite poets, Alyssia Harris and Zora Howard, both of whom no longer produce poetry. I decided to use retired poets for this project because I felt that it was in line with the theme: that past inspiring the future. However, there also exists an element of aspiration in this decision where I hope that the future does hold more work from these two poets. 

 

After deciding on who I wanted to tell the story about the future, I needed to think about what that narrative/story would be. For this, I looked to AI. AI has become synonymous with "the future" in whatever media outlet one consumes. There are many valid reasons why that is the case seeing as the future of many disciplines including medicine, design, computing, etc. are dependent on the advancements made in artificial intelligence.  With this in mind, I thought, "why not let the future talk about the future?" So I became familiar with the machine learning model, GPT-2, created the necessary code to train GPT-2 (with a lot of my code being borrowed from Max Woolf) I also included another machine learning model known as the Markov Chain Generator for stylistic and grammatical construction of the narrative in question. 

I trained these two models with poems from Zora and Alessia with the prompts "future love", "future New York", “future youth”, and “future today” and the results were beautiful and coherent poems that talk about the future of love, youth, today, and New York through a series of metaphors and anecdotes.

 

In presenting this work I wanted to combine elements of digital Afrofuturism art as well as African music that comprises what the continent considers to be both the future and the past of African music. I decided to feature the works of four Afrofuturists who are not very well known but whose work is extremely beautiful and who I wanted to advertise through my project. These artists are Osborne Macharia, Taj Francis, Manzel Bowman, and Khan Nova. The music I chose includes less popular African instruments such as the zeze and the ndarimbo of East Africa. It also includes a song, “Short N Sweet” from a Kenyan futurist band, Sauti Sol.

In the end, I had a website where it almost seemed as if the west and Africa, the past, and the future were in conversation. The west with its English poems about New York and Paris and Africa with its Afrofuturist art and African songs. The future with its AI produced poetic narrations about the future and the past with its beautifully timeless music and artists. This effect is intentional as this is what I envision for the future more and more interconnectedness to the point where cultures will be speaking directly to each other. I recognize the massive role that the internet plays in accomplishing this and that is why, to pay homage to the powerful connector, I decided to house my project online, on a website.

 

I really enjoyed working on this project and I hope you have fun experiencing it:)
